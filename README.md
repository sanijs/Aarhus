# LoRaWAN Frequency Plans for The Things Stack

This repository contains default frequency plans to be used with The Things Stack.

Frequency plans for The Things Stack contain channels, data rates and radio configuration, as well as settings to comply with regional regulations, i.e. time-off-air, dwell time and listen-before-talk.

Frequency plans are defined for a band. Bands are specified by the LoRa Alliance Technical Committee and are published as the [LoRaWAN Regional Parameters technical document](https://lora-alliance.org/resource-hub).

## File Format

Frequency plan are defined in YAML files. Most settings in the frequency plan are optional. When not specifying optional settings, the band defaults are used.

```yml

An index of frequency plans is in `frequency-plans.yml`:

```yml
- id: EU_863_870_TTN       # ID of the frequency plan
  base-id: EU_863_870      # ID that this frequency plan extends
  name: Region 863-870 MHz # Name of the frequency plan, ending with frequency ranges
  base-frequency: 868      # Base frequency in MHz for hardware support (433, 470, 868 or 915)
  country-codes: []        # List of 2-digit ISO country codes for countries where this plan can be used
  file: EU_863_870.yml     # File of the frqeuency plan definition
```

> Country codes are taken from the [LoRaWAN Regional Parameters 1.0.1 Specification](https://lora-alliance.org/sites/default/files/2020-06/rp_2-1.0.1.pdf)

## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in building this thing together with us. We're really happy with our active community and are glad that you're a part of it.

The Things Stack uses the `github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-frequency-plans` as default source for fetching frequency plans. Therefore, contributing to this open source repository makes frequency plans automatically available to Stack deployments with default settings. You can contribute by submitting pull requests. Are you new to GitHub? That's great! [Read here about pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Please also use the editor settings as defined in `.editorconfig`.

When submitting a new frequency plan or making changes to an existing frequency plan, please make sure that the band is allowed to be used in the concerning region and that settings respect regional regulations.

The Things Stack supports at least the following bands:

- `AS_923`: Asia 923 MHz
- `AU_915_928`: Australia 915 - 928 MHz
- `CN_470_510`: China 470 - 510 MHz
- `CN_779_787`: China 779 - 787 MHz
- `EU_433`: Europe 433 MHz
- `EU_863_870`: Europe 863 - 870 MHz
- `IN_865_870`: India 865 - 867 MHz
- `KR_920_923`: Korea 920 - 923 MHz
- `RU_864_870`: Russia 864 - 870 MHz
- `US_902_928`: United States 902 - 928 MHz

See the [LoRaWAN Regional Parameters](https://lora-alliance.org/resource-hub) for more band definitions. If you want to contribute to the band settings, please contribute to [The Things Stack for LoRaWAN](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack).
